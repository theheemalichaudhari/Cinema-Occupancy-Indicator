The Cinema Occupancy Indicator is a device that ensures transparency between the viewer  and the multiplex owner in order to decide a film's popularity and to ensure effective sync. The key objective of this project is to facilitate the estimation of the number of theatrical  players and to view them on an LCD screen so that the owner can monitor how many people  see the film and the number of seats sold. It will both help the spectator and the owner of the  multiplex to make better future decisions and respond to the reactions of other audiences. 
The IR sensor's activity principle, an infrared sensor, is an electrical device that emits light in  order to detect an object in its surroundings. An IR sensor can detect motion as well as the  temperature of an object. In general, all objects in the infrared spectrum emit some kind of  thermal radiation. The circuit consists of a led, an LCD, an infrared sensor, and a Raspberry  Pi. 
The project's operation is as follows: when the user enters data, it is recorded, and the LED  and LCD react and provide the output.
